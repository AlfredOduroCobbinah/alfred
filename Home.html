 <h2><b><br><u> Introduction </b></br></u></h2>
 <p> My skills as a html programmer are top-notch and I take pride in crafting well-written 
and efficient code. Ever since Mr. Joseph Danso introduced us to Freecode camp, i took it upon
 myself to take is seriously as if my whole life depends on it.
For now i have been able to create a survey form <br>and hosted it. My friends reached out 
to me congratulating me and encouraging me to keep it up!! The first time  tried 
it i was so confused to be honest. i took my time to learn how to code to publish. 
i used a host called (tinyy.host) too publish my code. Joseph my closest friend had
 logged in already..
 It’s a passion that fuels my innovative ideas and helps me tackle challenges head-on.
 Beyond coding I create engaging content for social media, capturing the attention of my 
audience with creativity and authenticity. 
 As a sales marketer, I drive results with strategic campaign and persuasive techniques.
 My diverse skill set and enterpreneurial spirit set me apart in the digital world.
